I am recruiting 1-3 funded PhD students (Fall 2026 start) and potentially one postdoc to join me as I launch my lab at MIT EECS / MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).

Our lab in human-computer interaction (HCI) focuses on a vision of making the human senses programmable: so that, in the future, people might customize their sensory experiences as easily as adjusting a phone setting. To get there, we create devices that sense bodily signals, alter them, and feed them back into interaction, forming new input-output loops for the senses. This spans wearables and embedded systems, methods to record and stimulate the senses, and computational models for smell, taste, breathing, and interoception (also open to temperature and touch). We apply these approaches to areas such as interaction design, health, assistive technologies, and environmental safety, while staying broadly open to new intersections between the senses and computing (e.g., robotics, media studies, etc.).
